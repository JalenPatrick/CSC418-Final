# Computer Graphics â€“ Final Image Competition
### `By Jalen Patrick (1001344208)`

## Background
Final graphics project was originally ntended to be a 2D fireworks simulator. Fireworks are emitted from bottom of screen (y = 0) and explode when they reach their peak using an OpenGL particle generator.

As I was not able to get the particle engine working, I modified the project to simulate a physics engine. 20 boxes are launched from a randomly generated origin point with a variable gravitational effect.

The motion of the boxes are governed by the basic kinematic equations of motion to mimic real physical gravity.
